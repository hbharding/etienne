<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist that lives in San Francisco by way of New York.</p>

<p>I've most recently been <a href="https://youtu.be/0G-pe01RCTk" target="_blank">working</a> on the <a href="http://marketstreetprototyping.org/2016-festival/projects/pillars-of-reflection/" target="_blank">Pillars of Reflection</a> with my buddy Tim – it was an installation that was part of the <a href="http://marketstreetprototyping.org/" target="_blank">Market Street Prototyping Festival</a> organized by San Francisco Planning and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.

<p>Right now I'm a senior creative strategist at Dropbox; prior to that I was at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, where I worked on Adobe and Doritos.  Some fun stuff we've made includes the work for Adobe's "Do You Know What Your Marketing Is Doing?" campaign, which breaks the enterprise communication mold by speaking to CMOs in a tongue-in-cheek way that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNmRJiRarH0" target="_blank">stings</a> a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao7wOJ5qQ-s" target="_blank">little</a>.  We launched Adobe Stock by recreating lost and stolen art using only stock imagery in <a href="http://www.adobestockmasterpiece.com/" target="_blank">Make your Masterpiece</a>.  And I've also been involved in extending the Doritos brand beyond the slapstick Super Bowl humor that the brand is famous for with <a href="https://www.time.com/4038837/doritos-rainbow-chips-pride-lgbt/" target="_blank">Doritos Rainbows</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DoritosUSA/videos/10154860232226165/" target="_blank">Doritos No Choice</a>. </p>
    
<p>Other places I've worked include Naked Communications NY and Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai, and I founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>I'm convinced that there's always a different, better way to do things.  Whether it's design or communications, "better" needs to be underpinned by a deep understanding of how people think, behave, and are influenced by their environment.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie who believes in Brad Stevens, a tech geek still bummed by the death of Google Reader, and an ex-online poker player who miraculously recovered his funds from the DOJ.  Sometimes I <a href="https://twitter.com/etiennehma" target="_blank">tweet</a> about things that catch my attention.</p>

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist that lives in San Francisco by way of New York.</p>

<p>I currently work at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, have worked at Naked Communications and Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai, and founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>I believe that crafting valuable experiences for people will drive positive business results. Whether that experience is created through design or communications, it needs to be underpinned by a deep understanding of how people think, behave, and are influenced by their environment.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie happy the Boston Celtics landed Marcus Smart and James Young <strike>Jabari Parker,</strike> <strike>Aaron Gordon and/or Kevin Love (!)</strike>, a tech geek still bummed about the death of Google Reader, and an ex-online poker player who miraculously rescued his funds from the DOJ.</p>
