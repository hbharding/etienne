<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist that lives in New York.</p>

<p>I currently work at Naked Communications, have worked at Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai, and founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca Cola.</p>

<p>I believe that crafting valuable experiences for people will drive positive business results. Whether that experience is created through design or communications, it needs to be underpinned by a deep understanding of how people think, behave, and are influenced by their environment.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie rooting for the Boston Celtics to land Jabari Parker, a tech geek still bummed about the death of Google Reader, and an ex-online poker player who miraculously retried his funds from the DOJ.</p>
