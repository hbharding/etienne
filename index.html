<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist that lives in San Francisco by way of New York.</p>

<p>I currently work at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, have worked at Naked Communications and Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai, and founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>I believe that crafting valuable experiences for people will drive positive business results. Whether that experience is created through design or communications, it needs to be underpinned by a deep understanding of how people think, behave, and are influenced by their environment.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie happy the Boston Celtics landed Marcus Smart and James Young <strike>Jabari Parker,</strike> <strike>Aaron Gordon and/or Kevin Love (!)</strike>, a tech geek still bummed about the death of Google Reader, and an ex-online poker player who miraculously rescued his funds from the DOJ.</p>

<h2>Say Hello!</h2>

Sometimes I'll blog about <a href="http://etiennema.wordpress.com/">random things</a>.</p>
