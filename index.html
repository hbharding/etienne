<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m a Hong Kong-born, Taipei and Shanghai raised strategist that lives in San Francisco by way of New York.</p>

<p>I've most recently been working on the <a href="http://marketstreetprototyping.org/2016-festival/projects/pillars-of-reflection/">Pillars of Reflection</a> as part of the <a href="http://marketstreetprototyping.org/">Market Street Prototyping Festival</a> jointly organized by San Francisco Planning and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.  Here's a little <a href="https://youtu.be/0G-pe01RCTk">timelapse</a> of me and my buddy Tim building the installation...  </p>

<p>I currently work at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, where I work on Adobe and Doritos.  Some fun stuff we've made includes <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNmRJiRarH0>some</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao7wOJ5qQ-s>work</a> for Adobe's Do You Know What Your Marketing Is Doing? campaign, <a href="https://www.time.com/4038837/doritos-rainbow-chips-pride-lgbt/">Doritos Rainbows</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DoritosUSA/videos/10154860232226165/">Doritos No Choice</a> </p>
  
<p>I've also worked at Naked Communications and Wieden+Kennedy Shanghai, and founded the Brown Advertising Club in Providence, Rhode Island.  My past work has involved clients that include the Milwaukee Bucks, Nike, UNICEF, Virgin Atlantic, GSK, NBC, and Coca Cola.</p>

<p>I believe that crafting valuable experiences for people will drive positive business results. Whether that experience is created through design or communications, it needs to be underpinned by a deep understanding of how people think, behave, and are influenced by their environment.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m a hoops junkie who believes in Brad Stevens, a tech geek still bummed about the death of Google Reader, and an ex-online poker player who miraculously recovered his funds from the DOJ.</p>
